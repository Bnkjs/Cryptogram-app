## **Buy, Share Cryptocurrencies with your contacts**
CRYPTOGRAM is a financial digital currency wallet clone (Binance, Coinbase...) which allows you to exchange and transfer cryptocurrencies.

Cryptogramp isn't connected with a real API so you can't buy any crypto-currencies.
The goal was to create a JS fullstack application with an auth, a database, a server / client side, a global state management and API calls.
